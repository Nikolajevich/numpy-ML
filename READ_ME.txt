This project investigates the accuracy of detecting people in an electromagnetic field with a Wi-Fi source placed inside a room equipped with detectors. The detectors are measuring the power present in a received signal over time. The data gathered from the detectors is used by a neural network for model training and predicting the number of people occupying the room.

The folder "19_10_2022" contains multiple folders that contain excel files. Each folder in "19_10_2022" represents a measurement that lasted 20 minutes when there was a certain number of people in the room (the number of people is indicated in the name of the folder). Each excel file corresponds to each of the 9 detectors used during measurement. The detectors are measuring the RSSI value from a WiFi source at a rate of 10 RSSI value readings per second.
